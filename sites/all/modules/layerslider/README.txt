The LayerSlider module is intended to provide UI for LayerSlider. It provides
block for each created slider so user can easily assign sliders to regions. This
module doesn't contain the LayerSlider library which will need to purchased
separately. If you purchased one of my themes from Themeforest, you do not need
to purchase the library separately.
